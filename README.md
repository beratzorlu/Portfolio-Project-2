## Project Documentation
### Welcome to [Senatus: The Interactive Quiz Game]()

Senatus is a web development project created as the second portfolio project as a part of Code Institute’s full-stack web development course curriculum. It utilises HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 to provide an interactive and responsive front-end quiz game application to the user.

The present documentation will provide information critical to understanding the core design principles that enabled the development of the project. More specifically, details regarding the UX/UI development, application testing and deployment, code structure and maintainability, bug fixes and the planned future features for the project.

To provide conceptual context, Senatus is a history quiz game where the user is presented with questions about ancient Rome. The language used in the UI/UX design carries a narrative where players are referred to as senators, and the Roman Senate is testing their knowledge about the society they represent to gauge their intellectual capacity as roman statesmen.

While there will be more deliberation on the project design and development processes below, the principles of CARE had a significant impact on the creation of this project. Cohesion, accessibility, responsivity and essentiality were key areas that directly impacted the end product.

## User Experience (UX)

This project aims to achieve the fundamental purpose providing a robust quiz game experience to players.


### User Stories

- User Stories

    As a user, I want to be able to have agency over toggling the music on or off.
    As a user, I want to be able to see game instructions before starting the game.
    As a user, I want to be able to track my score performance while playing the game.
    As a user, I want to be able to track which question out of the total number of questions I am on.
    As a user, I want to be able to track how much time I have left to complete all questions.
    As a user, I want to be able to navigate the game with clearly labelled button.
    As a user, I want to be able to save my final score under my username.
    As a user, I want to be able to display my saved final score on a leaderboard on demand..

### Colour Palette


[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was a highly beneficial resource in this regard which provided significant help in identifying
matching colours that also have appropriate contrast.

### Typography

[Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/)'s recommended approach to choosing fonts on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/about) was sufficient in finding satisfactory font families. Below is the list of fonts used to stylize the text content of the project;

## Website Features

The design considerations that impacted the envisioned features were mainly structured around conventional website design. While there were more features planned in the initial stages of the project, some were not entertained to the benefit of serving the needs referenced in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. Thus, it was important to focus on a minimum viable project rather than prioritizing the implementation of further features for the sake of it. This would only bloat the website without adding much value to the user experience overall.

### Shared Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the website as a whole.

- #### Navigation

![navigation bar]()


- #### Hero Image



- #### Footer

![footer]())

- #### Favicon

![favicon]()

Designing a favicon for the website was a process that required a series of trials and errors to find the design that fit the project most appropriately. Providing image sizes that also fit different browsers and devices is an important concern in this area. 

[Canva](https://www.canva.com/) was the service that allowed the design and creation of this element.
